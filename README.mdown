# Dynamic App Previews for iOS 7 Multitasking

## Intro

Just a simple demo of what I think dynamic app previews could look like. I use Instagram as an example and show that in the iOS 7 app switcher, recent photos could be shown as a preview for Tnstagram, instead of the UITableView feed it does by default.

**Loads of this is not App Store safe** :P
